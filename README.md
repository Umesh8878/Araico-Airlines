- **Customer Portal:** Customers can search for available flights, view options, make bookings, and manage their reservations.
- **Modular Development:** The project follows a modular approach for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Database Integration:** Utilizes MySQL for data storage and Hibernate for seamless Java-Database integration.
